# Problem Statement:

  Stationary Shop Management System implementation based on the concept of managing stationary items that present in the store

  using c programming language.

# Description:

        The user can purchase all the available items in the Stationary shop.

    By default our program has static information about store information that consists of all the store details like number of books

    present,number of different stationary goods and their quantity etc., At first the user has to select whether he/she has to buy books or

    other stationary items. After that, he/she should enter the quantity of selected items then the system displays the total amount.

        The system does not create an external file to store the user’s data permanently.

    Stationary Shop Management system is developed using C Programming Language and different variables, strings have been used for the development of the project.


# Requirements:

	Operating System that supports execution of C-Program.

    A suitable IDE of C program that accepts data (Code Blocks is used).

    Header Files Required:

    ● <stdio.h> : The header file stdio.h stands for Standard Input Output.

              It has the information related to input/output functions.

              Used to perform input and output operations in C.

              Some of the Functions in stdio.h in C language :  printf(),scanf(),getc(),putc(),fopen(),fclose(),remove(), etc.,

    ● <conio.h> : The conio.h stands for console input/output.

              The header file used in C programming language contains functions for console input/output.

              Some of its most commonly used functions are clrscr, getch, getche, kbhit etc.

              They can be used to clear screen, change color of text and background, move text, check whether a key is pressed or not and to perform other tasks.

              console input/output.

    ● <string.h>: The header file header in the C standard library which contains macro definitions, constants and declarations of functions

              and types used not only for string handling but also various memory handling functions.


# Test Plan:

   Test plan is necessary for testing.

   Software Testing is a method to check whether the actual software product matches expected requirements to ensure that software product is Defect free.

   It involves execution of software/system components using manual or automated tools to evaluate one or more properties of interest.

   The purpose of software testing is to identify errors, gaps or missing requirements in contrast to actual requirements.

   Some prefer saying Software testing as a White Box and Black Box Testing.


# Features to be tested :

  1. Verify which option is selected from menu (from customer as option selection as 0 or 1).

  2. If 1 is selected from menu get which number is chosen (ie., customer has choice to select options 1,2,3 further)

  3. If 0 is selected from main get which number is chosen next.(ie., customer has choice to select options 4,5,6 further)

  4. Quantity of required item is taken or purchased by the customer.

  5. Checks if the customer is old customer or new customer and allot discount if eligible.


# Expected Results:

	On Successful Execution of Src file keep available to the user or customer to buy goods either it is books and stationary products.

	And also consists option for the admin to add the products if any updations required in the stock and also can able to get display

	of remaining products with count.

	After completion of selection process carried out by the customer it produces total fare with applicable discount that is payable by the customer.
