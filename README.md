# StationaryShop-Management

Stationary Shop Management System is based on the concept of managing stationary items that present in the store.

The user can freely use the system and its features since there is no login system available for this system. 

This mini project contains limited features, but the essential one.

The user can purchase all the available items in the Stationary shop.

By default our program has static information about store information that consists of all the store details like number of books present ,

number of different stationary goods and their quantity etc.,

At first the user has to select whether he/she has to buy books or other stationary items.

After that, he/she should enter the quantity of selected items then the system displays the total amount.

The system does not create an external file to store the userâ€™s data permanently.

Stationary Shop Management system is developed using C Programming Language and different variables, strings have been used for the development of it.
