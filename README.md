# StationaryShop-Management
The mini project mainly based on the concept of managing Stationary items tht present in the store.
The user can freely use the system and its features since there is no login system available for this system.
The user can purchase all the available items in the Stationary shop.

By default our program has static information about store information that consists of all the store details like :
number of books present,number of different stationary goods and their quantity etc., 

This system provides assurance of proper accuracy and efficiency there by calculating a discount after entering all the wanted list of the user or customer .

Features :
a.	The program is written for searching in string , so that when the customer will enter the name of the book required,that particular book can be searched in the string present.
b.	The program also tells the shopkeeper about the objects which are insufficient in number.
c.	And also as the items will be purchased its quantity will be subtracted from the present stock.
d.	The program also has added membership in this program to know the regular and new customers..eg whether the customer is a regular customer or new.

This program will provide basic idea about:
 1.The stationary items present in the shop
 2.And their price 
 3.The number of items present and purchased 
 4.Their MRP and discount offer 
 5.About various books information that present in the store
 6.Including their details like author name,publication,core subject,price etc.,
