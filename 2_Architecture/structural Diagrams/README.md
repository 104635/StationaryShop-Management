STRUCTURAL DIAGRAMS :


  Structural diagrams depict the elements of a system that are independent of time and that convey the concepts of a system and how they relate to each other. 
  
  The elements in these diagrams resemble the nouns in a natural language, and the relationships that connect them are structural or semantic relationships.
  
  For example, a structural diagram of a vehicle reservation system might contain elements such as Car, Reservation, Drivers License and Credit Card, and connectors linking 
  
  these  elements. 
  
  Experienced modelers will also show relationships to behavioral elements on these diagrams.
  
  There exists some types of Structural diagrams ,those are like : 
  
      1. Class diagrams : class diagram capture the logical structure of the system, the Classes and objects that make up the model, describing what exists and what attributes 
      
      and behavior it has.

      2. Composite Structure diagrams : Those diagrams reflect the internal collaboration of Classes, Interfaces and Components (and their properties) to describe a 
      
      a functionality.

      3 Component diagrams : Component diagrams that illustrate the pieces of software, embedded controllers and such that make up a system, and their organization and
      
      dependencies.

      4. Deployment diagrams : Deployment diagrams show how and where the system is to be deployed; that is, its execution architecture.

      5. Object diagrams : Object diagrams are depict object instances of Classes and their relationships at a point in time.
