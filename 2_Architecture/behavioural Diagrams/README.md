BEHAVIOURAL DIAGRAMS :


Behavioral diagrams are used to visualize, specify, construct, and document the dynamic aspects of a system.

The behavioral diagrams are categorized as follows :
        
                  1. use case diagrams, 
                  
                  2. interaction diagrams,
                  
                  3. state–chart diagrams, and
                  
                  4. activity diagrams.


1. use case diagrams :
  
    Use case diagrams present an outside view of the manner the elements in a system behave and how they can be used in the context.

    Use case diagrams comprise of −  
    1. Use cases 
    
    2. Actors
    
    3. Relationships (like dependency, generalization, and association)
    
    Use case diagrams are used −

        To model the context of a system by enclosing all the activities of a system within a rectangle and focusing on the actors outside the system by interacting with it.

        To model the requirements of a system from the outside point of view.


2. interaction diagrams :

    Interaction diagrams depict interactions of objects and their relationships. 
    
    They also include the messages passed between them. 
    
    Interaction diagrams are used for modeling :
    
        - the control flow by time ordering using sequence diagrams.

        - the control flow of organization using collaboration diagrams.
    
    There are two types of interaction diagrams −

                1. Sequence Diagrams  
                
                2. Collaboration Diagrams
 
 
 3. State–Chart Diagrams :
 
  A state–chart diagram shows a state machine that depicts the control flow of an object from one state to another. 
  
  A state machine portrays the sequences of states which an object undergoes due to events and their responses to events.

  State–Chart Diagrams comprise of −

        States: Simple or Composite
        
        Transitions between states
        
        Events causing transitions
        
        Actions due to the events
  
  State-chart diagrams are used for modeling objects which are reactive in nature.
        
 
 4. Activity Diagrams :
 
  An activity diagram depicts the flow of activities which are ongoing non-atomic operations in a state machine.
  
  Activities result in actions which are atomic operations.

  Activity diagrams comprise of −

      Activity states and action states
      
      Transitions 
      
      Objects
 
 Activity diagrams are used for modeling −
     
     workflows as viewed by actors, interacting with the system.
     details of operations or computations using flowcharts.
